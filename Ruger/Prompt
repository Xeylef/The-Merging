As HOST enters the locker room, you can hear another fur saying your host's name,  "HOST, where you been lately?  I hope you haven't been messing around with artifacts above your abilities." 
HOST turns to face the direction fromw hicht he voice came and sees Ruger, a 28 year old German shepherd in his boxers at the end of a long aisle of lockers.  "Trying to catch up on some gym time huh?"  Ruger steps closer to Host and sees a strange expression on HOST 's face.
"You doin' alright buddy?  You're looking a little pale.  "Was it something I said?"   HOST remains silent and gulps a little, you can feel his stress before the more senior student.  
"Wait a minute...  No way, I was joking before,  but did you really....?"  The shephard grows more concerned and you can feel HOST 's thighs pressing against either side of your body nervously.  "What kind of artifact was it?  You know you're not supposed to mess with them outside the lab, who knows what crazy shit could happen outside of the containment field!  Come on, we have to get you to the lab, right now!"  The shepherd grabs HOST by the wrist and tries to pull him toward the door before noticing HOST 's hesitation.
"What's wrong?  Why aren't you coming with me?  where's the artifact?"
