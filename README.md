# The-Merging
CTF game project

ALRIGHT! Welcome to the github! 

Here is the plan. I have had numerous offers of help for the game. However scenes can be.... tricky to write as every scene is highly variable and modular. Unlike games such as CoC TiTs or even Flexible survival.


SO THIS IS THE PLAN! PROMPTS!

I will create seperate readmelike documents in here with a prompt that I welcome others to create a response scene to! As well as a wild card scene prompt. Oddly enough scenes from RPs with others could contain usefull tidbits. But only single sections so don't go and post a whole RP. 

Each entry should only be a paragraph long. As in the game everything is done in paragraph chunks
